Summary
-------
These results show that Citibike's are widely used in New York, however, it will be difficult to know if this will translate to Des Moines as the demographics of the two cities are very different. There are two additional visualizations that may help analyze this data further:

1. Average amount of time that each customer has been with Citibike and their usage.
2. Average trip length in distance.
